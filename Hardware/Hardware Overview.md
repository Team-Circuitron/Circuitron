## Hardware Overview

### Processing Unit
- **Raspberry Pi Zero**  
Acts as the brain of the robot, managing camera input, motor control, and sensor integration.  
Compact yet powerful enough for real-time decision-making.  

### Locomotion
- **Custom DC Motor (8000 rpm at 3.7v)**  
- **Coupled with TB6612FNG motor driver**  
Provides precise torque and control for dynamic movement in competition.  

### Motor Driver
- **TB6612FNG Dual H-Bridge Driver**  
Handles motor currents efficiently while minimising heat.  
Supports smooth acceleration and braking.  

### Power Management
- **Buck Converter (5V, 3A)**  
Ensures stable voltage delivery to sensitive components such as Raspberry Pi, IMU, and sensors.  

### Sensors
- **Limit Switch**  
Used for collision detection
- **9-axis IMU (Gyroscope + Accelerometer + Magnetometer)**  
Provides orientation and stability feedback.  

### Camera System
- **Raspberry Pi Camera Module**  
Essential for wall detection, object detection, and parking.  

### User Interface
- **Push Buttons**  
Allow reset or emergency stop functionality.
