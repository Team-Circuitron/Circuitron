Â Hardware Overview

Our robotic platform is engineered with a modular hardware architecture to deliver high performance, flexibility, and support iterative development cycles.

 Processing Unit

The computational backbone of the system is the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, chosen for its quad-core processor and versatile GPIO interface. This board supports seamless integration of sensor arrays and enables real-time control algorithms essential for autonomous navigation and decision-making.

Â Vision System

We employ the Raspberry Pi Camera Module, selected for its native compatibility with the Raspberry Pi ecosystem. This camera enables obstacle detection, line tracking, and environmental mapping, forming a critical component of the perception subsystem.

Locomotion

The locomotion system uses LEGO wheels, chosen for their superior material quality and precise engineering. Their modularity allows rapid iterations of mechanical designs.

The chassis is powered by a [Insert Model] DC motor, optimized for size, weight, and torque output, ensuring efficient mobility.

Steering System

Steering is controlled by a [Insert Model] high-precision servo motor, delivering responsive and accurate control critical for navigating dynamic environments.

Power Management

A [Insert Model] buck converter manages power delivery, stepping down from [Insert Voltage]V to levels required by all subsystems. This ensures stable operation and protects sensitive electronics.

Chassis

The structural framework leverages a LEGO-based chassis, chosen for its modularity and ease of customization. This design supports quick repositioning of components and continuous mechanical optimization.
