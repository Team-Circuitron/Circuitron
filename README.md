## Strategy
Rather than using the ultrasonic sensor, we have decided to use the Raspberry Pi camera, utilising the contours of the walls to execute a wall following program. When the robot detects an obstacle, it utilises the obstacle as a reference to wall follow between the wall and the obstacle. For turning, we use the blue or orange lines on the game field to take a turn, and if the next obstacle is too close, we will take a dummy reverse and resume our wall following code
